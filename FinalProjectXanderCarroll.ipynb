    "Classic video games offer a controlled and well-understood environment for experimenting with machine learning, providing clear objectives and measurable rewards without the complexity of modern games. This project will explore training a reward-based neural network to play Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The game state will be extracted using an NES emulator and encoded into a representation suitable for a neural network. The network will then be trained to maximize in-game rewards such as level progress and the level timer. It is anticipated that this approach will demonstrate how simple, reward-driven models can learn effective strategies in constrained environments."

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "Developing artificial agents that can learn to play video games has long been a benchmark problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. While modern games offer highly complex environments, classic games like Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) provide simpler, well-defined environments where objectives, rewards, and state representations are clear. The problem we aim to solve is training a reward-based neural network to play Super Mario Bros, using in-game feedback to guide learning. This requires designing a system that can interpret the game state, map it into a format suitable for a neural network, and optimize agent behavior to choose the controller inputs that will maximize cumulative rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "This project advances research in reinforcement learning by testing how reward-based neural networks can learn behavior in simple, well-defined environments. Classic games like Super Mario Bros provide an ideal platform for such experiments. It is easy to simulate, has clear objectives, and still requires sequential decision-making and adaptation. By evolving a neural network to play the game using only in-game rewards as feedback, this project explores how complex behavior can emerge from simple fitness functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Our primary environment is the NES version of [Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros).$`^1`$ This game is one of the most popular from its era, has been reverse engineered, and is very well documented by the community. Super Mario Bros is a side-scrolling platformer. The player's goal is to make forward progress, eventually reaching the end of the level while avoiding hazards. The [BizHawk](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk) NES emulator will be used to provide a programmatic interface to read the game's memory and feed controller inputs to the game in real-time.$`^2`$ This will allow the neural network to \"see\" and \"interact\" with the game. The problem is framed as a reward-based learning task, where the agent receives feedback proportional to in-game progress, creating a natural fitness function for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "Input(s): The algorithm will recieve the current game state from the BizHawk emulator. This will include a map of the level, with terrain layout, enemy locations, and the player's current progress. This information will be encoded into a representation suitable for neural network processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output(s): The network will produce a set of controller inputs (e.g., hold left, press button A) to be executed in the game environment. Eventually, we expect these controller outputs to maximize the fitness function (player's foward progress in the level). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Goal:**\n",
    "Train a fitness-based neural network to autonomously play Super Mario Bros and achieve measurable progress through one or more levels. The primary metric is maximizing cumulative in-game reward, including level completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stretch Goal:**\n",
    "Extend the model to generalize across multiple levels or similar games. This will include testing whether a network trained on one level can adapt to unseen layouts."

    "Because this project uses a self-contained video game environment, the ethical concerns are relatively minimal compared to many real-world machine learning applications. The data used to train the model comes entirely from the \"Super Mario Bros\" game itself. This means there is no personal, demographic, or sensitive data involved, and thus no risk of violating data privacy or introducing human-related bias. The training process is purely synthetic, relying on game-generated feedback rather than external datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential misuse is also limited, as the model is designed for research and educational purposes. However, as with many AI techniques, the underlying algorithms (Deep Q-Learning and NEAT) could theoretically be adapted for automation or control systems in other domains, where ethical considerations such as fairness, accountability, or safety would become more significant.\n",

    "## 5. The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project is not a static collection, but a stream of real-time input vectors extracted from the NES game \"Super Mario Bros.\" as it runs inside the BizHawk emulator. Each sample corresponds to a single game frame and consists of a simple encoding for the state of the level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the game runs at 60 frames per second, the agent will generate tens or hundreds of thousands of frames through its own gameplay attempts, which serve as the training data. Because the agent continuously produces new states through exploration, the traditional split into training, validation, and test sets does not directly apply. Instead, the \"training\" set will be the ammount of frames the agent spends learning the game, while the \"testing\" set is given by releasing the final agent to play various levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Spesifics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is very simple. Each frame, N blocks around the player are represented with a state vector. The vector encodes \"air\" as zeros, \"tiles\" as ones, and \"enemies\" as negative ones. Later, additional information might be included in this vector, such as mario's position, the level timer, or the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All preprocessing occurs inside a Lua script running in BizHawk. The script reads specific memory addresses each frame (e.g., Mario’s position, tile map contents, and enemy locations) using the emulator’s API. These values are packaged into a compact vector representation of the current world state. An example of this encoding with N=6 (6 tiles of \"vision\" in any direction from the player) are shown below. In the second case, a red box is drawn with N=6 tiles around the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lua script then transmits each state vector to a Python backend via TCP, where it will be fed directly into the Q-learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset originates entirely from gameplay in Super Mario Bros (Nintendo, 1985) executed within the BizHawk open-source emulator. Data is collected from RAM while the game is being played.\n",

    "## 6. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Deep Q-Learning (DQN)\n",
    "The basic idea of Deep-Q-Learning is to train an agent to choose actions that maximize long-term reward. Instead of manually programming rules for how Mario should behave, the algorithm learns by playing the game and gradually estimating the \"reward\" that will be generated by taking different actions in a specific state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reward is quantified by the Q-function $Q(S,A)$. This function answers the question, *if the agent takes action A in state S, how much total reward should it expect?* Classic Q-Learning uses a lookup table, but for games like *Super Mario Bros.*, there are too many possible input states to build a table for them all. So we will use Deep Q-Learning which replaces the table with a neural network that *approximates* the Q-function, allowing the agent to generalize in situations that the programmer hasn't seen. The following image highlights these differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"img/q-learning-1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<small><cite>Figure from: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Q-Learning-vs-Deep-Q-Learning-Difference-in-the-agents-brain-In-Q-learning-the_fig4_382675650</cite>.$`^3`$</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow will handle the neural network that approximates this Q-function. On each frame, the model receives a state vector. It will then output a predicted Q-value for each action (each button on the controller). Actions with the highest predicted reward values will be selected. As the agent plays, it will store its past experiences, and use them to train the neural network. Many different kinds of neural networks can be used as a Q function, but convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a common option. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "While CNNs are not used in every DQN implementation, they provide a helpful way to understand how the algorithim typically processes game data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN works by finding patterns in structured data, especially image vectors like the one extracted from *Super Mario Bros*. Instead of connecting every tile to every neuron, a CNN uses a sliding kernel that moves across the input in order to detect features of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the broader DQN application, CNNs are used as a Q function. Each frame of the game can be processed by the CNN, and that network can be used to predict the outcomes of different actions. A loss function will then measure how correct that prediction was, and backpropogation will be used to update each parameter in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because CNNs are not the focus of the project, this summary was rather concise. For more information, see [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning/convolutional-neural-network-cnn-in-machine-learning/) resource.$`^4`$"

    "\n",
    "**Experimental Setup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps should be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The \"BizHawk\" emulator should be downloaded.$`^{2}`$\n",
    "2) The lua \"sockets\" library should be downloaded and included in the BizHawk installation folder.$`^{5}`$ \n",
    "3) This repository should be cloned.\n",
    "4) A copy of the \"Super Mario Bros.\" ROM file should be obtained and opened in the emulator. \n",
    "5) Place mario at the start of the level you would like to train and save the game in save-slot 1.\n",
    "6) Start the `MarioServer.py` script (or run the code cell in this notebook). Wait for the \"Server Started\" notice.\n",
    "7) Open the `Mario.lua` script in the BizHawk emulator (tools -> lua console -> file -> open).\n",
    "\n",
    "The python server will then take control  of Mario and the model will begin to be trained. You can press the escape key to disconnect the client and terminate the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run the python server or the lua client, you can optionally change several hyperparameters. The parameters have been tuned manually, and will be refined in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`HIDDEN_LAYERS`** and **`HIDDEN_NODES`:** These parameters control the structure of the neural network.\n",
    "- **`W_*`:** These variables control how much weight is given for different actions when calculating the reward that the model has.\n",
    "  - **`W_TIME`:** How much Mario is punished for taking too long.\n",
    "  - **`W_DISTANCE`:** How much Mario is rewarded for moving to the right.\n",
    "  - **`W_DIED`:** How much Mario is punished for dying.\n",
    "  - **`W_WIN`:** How much Mario is rewarded for beating the level.\n",
    "- **`GAMMA`:** How much Mario prioritizes long term reward versues short term reward (gamma near 1 prioritizes long term gain).\n",
    "- **`EPSILON`:** The percentage of the time that the model takes a random action rather than the expected action. This allows the model to try new things.\n",
    "- **`VISION_SIZE:`** How many tiles mario can \"see\" in any direction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary metric is *reward*. This is the value that the model is trying to maximize. The goal of the model is to choose actions that will lead to the most reward signal in the long term. This is how that reward signal is currently calculated.\n",

    "We can see that reward is increased when Mario makes rightward progress or beats the level, and reward is decreased when Mario dies, moves to the left, or takes too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reward signal is high, that indicates that the model is doing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",

    "## 8. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing the agent in action provides clear visual confirmation that the network is capable of learning to play the game. If we watch for long enough, the agent is even able to complete the level! This behavior is mirrored quantitatively by the upward trend in reward over time. Initially, the agent acts almost randomly, often failing to make significant progress. As training continues, it gradually discovers actions that increase its reward. However, performance remains inconsistent. Temporary drops in reward occur when the agent falls into pits or collides with enemies, interrupting its forward progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "These fluctuations indicate that while the model learned effective strategies, it has not yet achieved complete mastery of the game environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative observations reveal that the agent struggles in specific situations. Particularly when moving left is required to continue making progress in the level. The agent is not able to overcome the short-term punishment to the reward function necessary to find long-term success. Some failures are likely due to limitations in the state representation, which captures only a fixed number of tiles around the player (the VISION_SIZE) and may miss relevant context for precise timing or positioning. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the agent learns directly from gameplay experiences rather than a static dataset, traditional overfitting is less of a concern. However, the model can still over-specialize to specific patterns it encounters during training, potentially reducing performance on unseen levels. Early experiments indicate that reward improvements generalize reasonably well across similar layouts, but moving the agent to drastically different levels did not show success.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitations of this project include the state representation. As a developer, I decided what parameters the network would be able to \"see\". Had I chosen to give the network more or less information, results may have changed. Additionally, the reliance on reward shaping may bias behavior toward short-term gains. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest limitation are the computational constraints of training over long periods. The agent will play the game in real-time or close to real-time. This means that to collect a large sample of data, the agent must train for long periods of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because training is conducted on a single game, results will not directly transfer to other games or platforms without additional adaptation.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 9. Conclusions & Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates that a Deep Q-Learning agent can learn to play Super Mario Bros on the NES, though wether the model can achieve full mastery remains an open question. By extracting the game state from the emulator and encoding it into a compact vector, the agent was able to interact with the environment and gradually improve its performance. Both visual observations and cumulative reward trends confirm that the agent learns to make forward progress and eventually complete levels, illustrating how complex behavior can emerge from simple reward signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Q-Learning proved effective for this task, as its neural network approximation of the Q-function enabled the agent to generalize across diverse game states and identify action sequences that maximize long-term reward. While DQN performed well, alternative approaches such as NEAT may offer advantages in certain scenarios. Past NEAT based aproaches have also proven more effective at tackling this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several avenues exist to extend this work. Combining multiple trained models or “breeding” networks that have learned complementary strategies could improve performance. Training networks over longer periods and on multiple levels would enhance generalization and robustness. Additionally, automated hyperparameter optimization could replace manual tuning, potentially yielding more efficient learning and higher-quality agents.\n",
